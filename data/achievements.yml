His meticulously designed experiments provided a definitive answer to the long-standing debate initiated by the EPR paradox, confirming the predictions of quantum mechanics over local realism and demonstrating the reality of what Albert Einstein famously called 'spooky action at a distance'. He shared the prize with John Clauser and Anton Zeilinger for their parallel and complementary work."

Leading a team at UCLA, she used groundbreaking adaptive optics techniques at the Keck Observatory to track the orbits of stars around Sagittarius A*. Her independent work, conducted in a friendly rivalry with Reinhard Genzel's group, provided the most convincing evidence to date for the existence of a supermassive black hole, a concept whose theoretical foundation was established by Roger Penrose's work on general relativity."

He developed the theoretical framework for how cosmic structure (galaxies, galaxy clusters) forms from initial small fluctuations through the gravitational influence of cold dark matter. This work, along with the observational evidence for dark matter from astronomers like Vera Rubin, laid the foundation for the Lambda-CDM model."

  text: "Co-authored the landmark B²FH paper ('Synthesis of the Elements in Stars'), which provided a comprehensive theory for how all chemical elements heavier than helium are created inside stars through nuclear fusion. This work, building on Hans Bethe's earlier explanation of energy in stars, remains the foundation of our understanding of cosmic chemical evolution."

  title: "The Steady State Theory"
  category: "Cosmology"
  text: "In collaboration with Hermann Bondi and Thomas Gold, Hoyle proposed the Steady State model of the universe. This theory suggested that the universe is eternal and, although expanding, maintains a constant density through the continuous creation of new matter. It was the main rival to the 'Big Bang' theory—a term Hoyle himself coined derisively—until it was largely disproven by observational evidence."

  title: "Quantum Electrodynamics and Feynman Diagrams"
  category: "Quantum Electrodynamics"
  text: "Developed a powerful and intuitive formulation of quantum electrodynamics (QED), the theory of how light and matter interact. He introduced his famous Feynman diagrams, a pictorial method for visualizing and calculating particle interactions. His work, developed independently alongside Julian Schwinger and Sin-Itiro Tomonaga, resolved key theoretical problems and remains a fundamental tool in particle physics."

He served as a group leader under Hans Bethe in the Theoretical Division, where he developed crucial computational methods for calculating the physics of the atomic bomb and helped engineer the project's computation center."

  text: "In a landmark paper, Dyson proved that the different formulations of quantum electrodynamics—the path-integral approach of Richard Feynman, and the operator methods of Julian Schwinger and Sin-Itiro Tomonaga—were mathematically equivalent. His work unified these approaches and made the complex theory accessible and usable for a generation of physicists."

  text: "Proposed the concept of a 'Dyson sphere', a hypothetical megastructure that an advanced civilization could build to completely encompass a star and capture all of its energy output. This speculative idea has become a staple of science fiction and a theoretical concept in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI)."

  category: "Cosmology, Observational Astronomy"
  text: "While working with Arno Penzias at Bell Labs, Wilson detected a persistent, uniform background noise in their radio antenna that they could not eliminate. They soon realized this signal was the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation, the remnant heat from the Big Bang. Their accidental discovery provided the strongest evidence for the Big Bang theory, confirming the theoretical predictions made by a team at Princeton University led by Robert H. Dicke."

  category: "Quantum Mechanics"
  text: "Demonstrated that high-energy photons, when scattered by electrons, lose energy and thus increase in wavelength. This phenomenon, which treats light as a stream of particles with momentum, provided definitive experimental proof for the particle nature of light that had been proposed by Albert Einstein in his work on the photoelectric effect. For this discovery, Compton was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1927."

Building on Max von Laue's discovery of X-ray diffraction, William Lawrence Bragg formulated the simple yet profound Bragg's Law (nλ = 2d sinθ), while William Henry Bragg developed the X-ray spectrometer to make the precise measurements. Their joint work allowed for the determination of crystal structures for the first time, for which they shared the 1915 Nobel Prize in Physics."

For this foundational work in surface chemistry, he was awarded the 1932 Nobel Prize.

  text: "Developed a model to explain the heat capacity of solids at low temperatures. His model treated atomic vibrations as collective modes (phonons), which was a significant improvement upon Albert Einstein's earlier model that assumed atoms vibrated independently.
